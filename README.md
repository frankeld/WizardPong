# WizardPong
Created with [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net) for cross-platform comptability and Visual Studio.

## Overview
In this twist on pong, Wizards battle to get a "care package" into the opponent's portal. However, each Wizard has special abilties that change the balance of the game!

This game supports one or two players. Each player has a wizard that can interact and manipulate the playing field using certain powers. These powers can also influence the other players. Try to get the care package into the portal blocked by the other wizard to support your army!

## Powers
  There are six powers in the game:
1. Fire ball: shoots from the player and stuns other player, preventing their movement
1. Force field: plants a force field on the stage right in front of Player, acting as a wall for a temporary time
1. Portal trap: puts a firewall in front of the portal, destroying the car package and restarting the round
1. Slow time: slows time for ball while in their territory
1. Slime ball: makes the opponent skid for a short time
1. Cloaking: makes the ball invisible
